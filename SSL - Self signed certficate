Generating a self signed certificate
======================================
[root ] $ mkdir /etc/nginx/ssl
[root ] $ openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 \
  -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout /etc/nginx/ssl/private.key \
  -out /etc/nginx/ssl/public.pem


Hit enter and accept all defaults.

req - We’re making a certificate request to OpenSSL
-x509 - Specifying the structure that our certificate should have. Conforms to the X.509 standard
-nodes - Do not encrypt the output key
-days 365 - Set the key to be valid for 365 days
-newkey rsa:2048 - Generate an RSA key that is 2048 bits in size
-keyout /etc/nginx/ssl/private.key - File to write the private key to
-out /etc/nginx/ssl/public.pem - Output file for public portion of key

With the public and private keys generated, we’re now able to move on and add SSL/TLS/HTTPS support to our web server.

After doing this you need to add below modules and give path to keys .
ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/public.pem;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/private.key;

Now, in the terminal try yusing https.
curl -k https://localhost

If you see certificates generating , you are good. This is complete method of generating SSL certificate and test them.
