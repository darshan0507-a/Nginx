Nginx Imp path to keep in mind:
==============================
- Default nginx configuration - /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
- Default data path from where default nginx webpage loads - /usr/share/nginx/html
html.index loads when nginx configured successfully.
50x.html loads when there is error.
- Error logs default location - /var/log/nginx/error.log
- Pid default location - /var/run/nginx.pid
- Main virtual host configuration which loads all .conf files - /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
If you delete default.conf then your default nginx webpage will not load because from this conf file only it listens to the port on which it will load and other config also.
